# Components

These are shared components used by the blocks. If there's a component that is more universally useful, it should go into [`@woocommerce/components`](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/tree/master/packages/components)â€“ these components are specific to the Gutenberg context.

The `*-control` components here are designed to exist in the `InspectorControls` sidebar, or in a Placeholder component for the "edit state" of a block.
