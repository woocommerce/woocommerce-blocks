# WooCommerce Blocks - Editor Components

These are shared components used in WooCommerce blocks for the editor (Gutenberg) UI. 

Many of our blocks need rich, smart components to provide an interface for selecting or configuring blocks with WooCommerce data. Often there are multiple blocks that need such components. Components in this collection are used in multiple blocks, and may include logic for working with Woo data specifically (e.g. products, shipping methods, product categories).

See [_Components & Storybook_](docs/contributors/storybook.md) doc for more information.
