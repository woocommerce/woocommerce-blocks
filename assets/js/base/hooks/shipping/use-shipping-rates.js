 * This is a custom hook that is wired up to the `wc/store/cart/shipping-rates` route.
 * Given a a set of default fields keys, this will handle shipping form state and load
 * new rates when certain fields change.
 *
 * @return {Object} This hook will return an object with three properties:
 *                 - {Boolean} shippingRatesLoading A boolean indicating whether the shipping
 *                   rates are still loading or not.
 *                 - {Function} setShippingAddress  An function that optimistically
 *                   update shipping address and dispatches async rate fetching.
 *                 - {Object} shippingAddress       An object containing shipping address.
 *                 - {Object} shippingAddress       True when address data exists.
