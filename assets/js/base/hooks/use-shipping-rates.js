/**
 * This is a custom hook that is wired up to the `wc/store/collections` data
 * store for the `wc/store/cart/shipping-rates` route. Given a query object, this
 * will ensure a component is kept up to date with the shipping rates matching that
 * query in the store state.
 *
 * @param {Object} query   An object containing any query arguments to be
 *                         included with the collection request for the
 *                         shipping rates. Does not have to be included.
 *
 * @return {Object} This hook will return an object with three properties:
 *                  - shippingRates        An array of shipping rate objects.
 *                  - shippingRatesLoading A boolean indicating whether the shipping
 *                                         rates are still loading or not.
