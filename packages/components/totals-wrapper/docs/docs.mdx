# TotalsWrapper

A wrapper to go around any items displayed in the "Totals" area of the Cart/Checkout blocks. Usually it comes with additional padding so the component rendered inside it doesn't need to add its own padding. If this is being used to wrap a Slot (for use in Slot/Fill patterns) then no padding will be applied.
