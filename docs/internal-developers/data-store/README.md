In our project, we leverage [`@wordpress/data`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-data/) data stores to hold information about the state of various WooCommerce blocks.

More information on the actions and selectors available on each data store can be found in the [third-party developer's data store documentation](../../third-party-developers/extensibility/data-store).
