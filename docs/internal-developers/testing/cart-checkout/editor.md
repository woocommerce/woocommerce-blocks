## What to test

-   [ ] You should be able to add one and only one Cart or Checkout block to a page.
-   [ ] The preview in the inserter should show a skeleton of how the block structure should look like.
-   [ ] When inserting any of the blocks, it should have some data already in it.
-   [ ] You should not be able to interact directly with the block (except for some sections).
-   [ ] You should be able to see block settings on the sidebar when it is focused.
-   [ ] Proceed to Checkout and Back to cart block settings should present you with a list of your website pages.
