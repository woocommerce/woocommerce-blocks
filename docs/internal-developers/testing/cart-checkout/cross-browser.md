# Cross-platform and browser compatibility

The main goal of this is to test in a variety of themes, browsers, platforms, and setups, this is a list of things you can test with, with sane expectations.

The baseline for testing is:

-   WordPress 5.4 and up.
-   WooCommerce 4.2 and up
-   All Browsers supported by [those two versions](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/browser-support/) so this includes Internet Explorer 11, and latest two versions of each browser.
-   Storefront, TwentyTwenty, and TwentyNineteen themes, we use storefront as a basis for development and push fixes to it regularly, so make sure you run the latest version.
