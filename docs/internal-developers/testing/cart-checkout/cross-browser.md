# Cross-platform and browser compatibility

The primary goal here is to conduct tests across a range of themes, browsers, platforms, and setups. Below is a list of elements you can test, with reasonable expectations:

The baseline for testing includes:

-   The latest stable version of WordPress.
-   The latest stable version of WooCommerce.
-   The latest stable core theme (for testing block-themes), and Storefront (for testing classic themes).
-   The latest two versions of [all browsers supported by WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/browser-support/).
