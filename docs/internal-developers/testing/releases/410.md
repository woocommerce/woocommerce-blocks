add_action( 'woocommerce_cart_calculate_fees', 'add_fee', 10 );

### Fix Address Validation in the Store API and client

White space:
For the white space issue, it's easier to test without this PR first to see what happened, and then test it worked.

-   [ ] Add something to the cart.
-   [ ] Go to checkout.
-   [ ] Enter a space character in the postcode field.
-   [ ] See if it validates or not. Before this PR it does notâ€”it allows checkout submission.

Validation via API
For validation, best to post to the API.

First add something to the cart via the API:

```sh
POST https://one.wordpress.test/wp-json/wc/store/cart/add-item
```

Body:

```json
{
	"id": 32,
	"quantity": 1
}
```

```sh
POST https://one.wordpress.test/wp-json/wc/store/checkout
```

Body:

```json
{
	"payment_method": "bacs",
	"billing_address": {
		"first_name": "Mike",
		"last_name": "Jolley",
		"address_1": "Test Address",
		"city": "Test City",
		"country": "US",
		"state": "AL",
		"postcode": "90210",
		"email": "test@test.com"
	},
	"shipping_address": {
		"first_name": "Mike",
		"last_name": "Jolley",
		"address_1": "Test Address",
		"city": "Test City",
		"country": "US",
		"state": "AL",
		"postcode": "90210"
	}
}
```

-   [ ] Leave out certain values to see validation errors. e.g. use an invalid email address, remove the state, enter an invalid state, use a non-existing country etc. Each will produce an error 400 and show a message.

Validation via Checkout

-   [ ] Also confirm checkout works as usual and this validation does not block. One thing you can do is checkout using a US address and enter a non-numeric zip code, e.g. ABC. You'll see error notices as the address updates and also if you try to place an order.

### Use em for coupon code button height

-   [ ] Set your browser font size to something smaller than 16px.
-   [ ] Open the Cart block and expand the Coupon Code panel.
-   [ ] Verify the button has the same height as the input text on the left.

### use ReplaceMediaFlow in featured category and feature product

-   [ ] Insert Featured Category and Featured Product
-   [ ] Try updating the image via media library or directly uploading.
-   [ ] There should be no console errors or warnings.
-   [ ] Your upload should work fine.

### Fix nonce issues when adding product to cart from All Products

-   [ ] In a private window, go to All Products, try to add to cart, it should work
-   [ ] Do it several times with several products.
-   [ ] Paginate the block and try to add products again.
-   [ ] If you have filters set up, try using filters and then adding to cart.
