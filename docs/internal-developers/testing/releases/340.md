Zip file for testing: [woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/files/5220435/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

## The following are changes that only impact Feature Plugin release

### Ensure shopper saved card is used as default payment method (default was being overwritten in some circumstances). ([3131](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3131))

-   Set up checkout page using block.
-   Enable BACS and Stripe payment methods (only, though may reproduce with other combinations). Note BACS needs to be earlier in the order than Stripe (drag handle in `WooCommerce > Settings > Payments`).
-   Complete a purchase using a new payment method, Stripe CC, check `Save payment information to my account for future purchases`.
-   Add something to cart, proceed to checkout.
-   Leave the default selected payment method - i.e. the first saved payment method. Submit checkout.

Should always complete the purchase with the correct payment method - the one visibly selected when user clicks submit, i.e. the saved card.

Please also test a variety of other payment method scenarios and ordering - with / without saved cards (are there any other gateways that support saved payment methods?), with more/less gateways available, in different orders, and with dynamically-available gateways (COD can depend on shipping option). In all cases confirm the following:

-   There is a payment method tab selected by default.
-   Submitting checkout without touching payment section uses the correct payment method (i.e. saved card, payment method tab).
-   Selecting a non-default saved card (from the default) works correctly, uses correct card/token (may need to check network requests to check token).
-   Selecting a non-default payment method uses correct method.
-   Saving a payment method (card) works and is available for use next checkout with that account.
-   Payment tab order should match the configured order.

### Fix Cart & Checkout sidebar layout broken in some themes. ([3111](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3111))

1. Install and activate [Artisan](https://woocommerce.com/products/artisan/) or [Threads](https://woocommerce.com/products/threads/) theme.

### Use wp_login_url instead of hardcoding login path. ([3090](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3090))

1. In an incognito window and add some products and then go to Checkout.
2. See the login URL, it should take you to `wp-login.php?redirect_to=[CURRENT_URL]`
3. Enable checkout for users only from WooCommerce -> Settings -> Accounts -> uncheck `Allow customers to place orders without an account`.
4. Visit Checkout again, the link should do the same.
5. Install and activate <https://wordpress.org/plugins/change-wp-admin-login/>.
6. Visit Settings -> Permalinks and change the login URL to something else.
7. Do 1,2,3 and 4 again, confirm that your value is respected.

### Fix an issue with COD not showing when first enabled. ([3088](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3088))

1. You can either test this on a new website, or delete `woocommerce_cod_settings` option from `wp_options` table.
2. Enable Cash on Delivery, don't set it up, leave everything as is, it should work with all shipping methods.
3. Create an order and enter a valid address that has a shipping method with it.
4. You will see COD as a payment option.
5. Go to COD settings, select a value for "Enable for shipping methods".
6. Save the settings.
7. Delete what was selected to return the field to its initial state.
8. Visit checkout again, COD is still working.

-   Fix JS console error when COD is enabled and no shipping method is available. ([3086](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3086))

1. Enable COD and limit it to a certain shipping method type.
2. Add that method to a certain address.
3. Select another address on the Checkout block, you shouldn't see an error with `selectedMethod is undefined` on the console.

### Create DebouncedValidatedTextInput component. ([3108](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3108))

Smoke test the Checkout block:

-   create a new page and add the Checkout block, change some attributes in the sidebar and verify changes take place
-   verify the Checkout block works in the frontend: try changing your address, picking a different shipping and payment method, etc.
-   verify you can make a purchase.

## The following impacts testing for both feature plugin and when included in WooCommerce Core

### Fix product reviews schema date fields to use new (WP 5.5) `date-time` format. ([3109](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3109))

-   Add some reviews for products.
-   Add an All Reviews block to post or page content.
-   Verify the frontend rendering of the block shows the expected dates for the reviews.

### Merge ProductPrice atomic block and component. ([3065](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3065))

Testing this change basically means verifying there are no regressions:

1. (For feature plugin testing only) Load the Cart and Checkout blocks. **_Verify_** product prices (default prices and on sale prices) are still rendered correctly. \

2. Add the All Products block in a page. **_Verify_** there are no regressions with the Product Price block.
3. Repeat the verifications above using a small viewport browser.
4. Repeat the verifications above using with the [Seedlet theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/seedlet/).
