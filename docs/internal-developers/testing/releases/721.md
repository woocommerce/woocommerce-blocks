## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce

### Hide deprecation notices before headers are sent. [#6074](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/6074)

1. Enable WooCommerce Payments or WooCommerce Subscriptions. It hasn't been updated with compatibility yet (I put in a PR a week ago).
2. Enable WP_DEBUG mode
3. Go to WP Admin. No notices are visible.
4. Check the error log. See the notices there.
5. Edit the code in this PR and remove the 7.4 from the function calls. Repeat steps 2-4 and confirm logs are used.
