### Standardise & refactor colors scss to align with Gutenberg colors and WooCommerce brand. ([3300](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3300))

Test all blocks in editor/frontend and verify there are no evident issues with its display (layout completely broken or colors that are not correctly assigned).
