## WooCommerce Core

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed address components in Firefox, and editing of address form in the editor ([#11714](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/11714))

1. Edit the checkout page
2. Address form should not be condensed
3. Toggle company/phone. Leave phone on. There should be no block errors.
4. Save changes and visit the checkout on the frontend (add something to cart if needed)
5. As a logged in user the address form should be condensed and phone should be visible. If no, fill out the form and place an order.
6. After placing the order go back to checkout and repeat the previous step. Phone should be visible in the condensed address component.
7. Go back to the editor and turn off the phone field. Save and go back to the frontend checkout. Ensure phone is hidden from the condensed address component.

##### Firefox testing

1. Add an item to the cart and go to checkout using Firefox
2. Fill out the form, then refresh the page.
3. The condensed address component is shown.
4. Edit the address. Ensure fields are populated with correct values.
