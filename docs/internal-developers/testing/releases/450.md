3. Repeat these steps several times, with different coupons and new baskets each time.

### Improve design of cart and checkout sidebars. ([3797](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3797))

Go to the Cart and Checkout block and verify designs look good. Some ideas of things to try:

### Improve error displayed to customers when an item's stock status changes during checkout. ([3703](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3703))

1. **In an incognito window** Add several products to your cart. Add these in differing quantities. Several of these added products need to have a quantity of 3+ in the cart.
2. Open the checkout page and ensure all the products are showing. **Do different combinations of the following steps in a different session to the one where you've added the items, and also without refreshing the checkout page. This is necessary because we can't be logged in as admin when testing step 3 below.**
3. Delete one or more of the products from the back end.
4. Set one or more of the products to "Manage stock?" true, and edit the in-stock amount of one or more of the products ensuring it is below the quantity that is in the cart, but above 0.
5. Set one or more of the products to "Sold individually"
6. Set one or more of the products to be entirely out of stock.
7. Try to check out and ensure you see the correct error messages for the products whose stock you've changed/reduced.
8. Try a few different scenarios with stock levels, number of products affected, number of products in cart etc.
