Zip file for testing: [woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/files/7886795/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce

### Update WooCommerce plugin slug for Block Templates ([5519](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/5519))

Note: This is mostly regression testing.

-   Activate the Gutenberg plugin (or use WordPress 5.9).
-   Download the Tove theme: <https://en-gb.wordpress.org/themes/tove/>. Unzip the theme and copy the archive-product.html file of this release's templates/block-templates directory to the theme's templates directory. Zip the theme folder and upload the theme to your test site.
-   Check Site Editor > Templates and ensure the new template in the theme overrides the default one provided by WooCommerce. Check this also renders correctly on the frontend and within the site editor.
-   Customise the newly created archive-product.html provided by your theme, ensure on the Site Editor > Templates list you are still seeing the customised template in this list and it renders correctly on the frontend, and in site editor.
-   Clear the customisations of the themes archive-product.html template to ensure this works correctly.
-   Check that we're now not receiving 404 network requests for WooCommerce templates on the Site Editor templates list page as described here: <https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/issues/5327>
