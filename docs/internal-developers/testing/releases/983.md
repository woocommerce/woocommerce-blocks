### Fix "Save changes" default behavior bug in the Firefox browser [#8754](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8754)

You should use the Firefox browser for this test.

1. Go to `WooCommerce/Shipping/Local pickup`
2. Click on the `Save changes` button. Ensure you are not redirected to another page, and the notice `Local Pickup settings have been saved.` is displayed

3. Make some changes (e.g., enable/disable local pickup, add/edit a pickup location, etc.)
4. Click on the `Save changes` button. Ensure you have the same results in step 2
5. Refresh the page. Ensure your changes are being saved

### Fix border styles not visible in the editor in Featured Product and Featured Category blocks [#8838](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8838)

Note: this can't be tested directly in WC Blocks. You should only test it in the WC core build.

0. Enable a block theme in your site (like [TT3](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/)).
1. Add a Featured Item (Featured Category or Featured Product) block to a page or post.
2. Select the border controls and add a border style. Add a color and give it some width.
3. You should see the border you set dynamically display on the featured item.
4. Now click on the `Unlink` button on the border controls and try setting different values for color and width for each of the border sides (top,right,bottom,left).
5. Ensure this is working by visually seeing the changes to the featured item.
6. Save and make sure this is also displaying correctly on the frontend.
7. Test both `Featured Category` and `Featured Product` blocks.
