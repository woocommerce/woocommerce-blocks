1. Activate Gutenberg plugin.
2. Go to Appearance > Editor > Add New to add a new template.
3. Click "Single Item: Product" template and create a product specific template
4. The block should render the placeholder for the Single Product.
5. Make changes to this template, and save them. Make sure these are represented on the frontend. Then clear the customizations and do the same.
6. Complete steps 3-5 again but instead create Product Category and Product Tag templates.

### Update - remove __experimentalDuotone from Featured Product and Featured Category blocks. ([7000](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7000))

1. Install a block theme (e.g., Twenty Twenty Two).
2. Open Appearance > Editor (beta).
3. Add a Featured Product and a Featured Category block.
4. Customize the global styles for those blocks (click on the Styles button on the top toolbar and then the Blocks section towards the bottom - _see screenshots below_).
5. Add some style adjustments and confirm they are reflected in the editor.
6. Save your changes and view a page driven by the modified Template on the front-end.

|  ![CleanShot 2022-08-26 at 22 05 58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/481776/187010061-8c68fcb6-14f5-4509-99ce-2ad3bff43369.png)  |  ![CleanShot 2022-08-26 at 22 03 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/481776/187009972-4c0bc853-4202-457e-8331-0f5b15d9f5e6.png)  |

_**Note:** the text color settings for this block are driven by inline styles that are added based on the Overlay and Color setting defaults. I imagine we want to keep those defaults in place so. To adjust this in the Editor, edit/remove those default settings on the block directly._
