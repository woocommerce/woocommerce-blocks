### Allow making the Cart/Checkout block page the default one from within the editor. ([6867](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/6867))

To test this feature you need the latest trunk of WooCommerce, or WooCommerce 6.9.0. For older versions of WC (pre 6.9.0), the notice would show the old text:

<img width="297" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6165348/184404663-11cac5f1-1729-4782-a39f-ee5f101a78a7.png">

1. Make sure you have a Cart and Checkout pages in WooCommerce -> Settings -> Advanced.
2. Those pages urls can be `/cart` and `/checkout`.
3. Open a new page, give it a title, insert Cart block.
4. Select Cart block, you should see the notice, select an inner block, you should see the notice as well.
5. Click on the notice, it will load for a couple of seconds, once it's green, visit your new page.
6. Make sure it's on the previous url, so `/cart`.
7. Go back to settings, make sure your new page is that value there.
8. Do the same thing for Checkout block.
9. Open a new page, add Cart block, save the page and publish it.
10. Select the block or one of its inner blocks, start the flow again.
11. It should work, confirm that by visiting the frontend.

### Register product search as a core/search variation when available. ([6191](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/6191))

1. Ensure the Gutenberg version is â‰¥ 13.4 and it is deactivated.
2. With a block theme (2022 for example), add the Product Search block to the header.
3. See the Product Search is the independent block (as it is in `trunk`), not a variation of the Search block. See the block is editable in the editor and working as expected on the front end.
4.  Activate Gutenberg.
5. On the front end, see the block is still working as expected and is still a WC block (notice the classes, and search icon).
6. Edit the header, see the Deprecation notice, and a call to action button to upgrade the search block to search variation.
7. Click on the CTA button to see if the block is converted to WC variation of the core search block.
8. Save and see the block functions flawlessly on the front end.
9. Edit the header again, try adding the Product Search block, only variation is available in the inserter. The legacy can't be found and inserted from the inserter.

### Fixed a bug with a class name deriving from a translatable string. ([6914](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/6914))

1. Add an item to your cart that has multiple variants. E.g. Hoodie (Blue, Logo)
2. Go to the Cart Block
3. Inspect the text for one of the variants (e.g. Colour: Blue)
4. Make sure there is a class called `wc-block-components-product-details__item` on the `<li>` element. This should be a child of `<ul className="wc-block-components-product-details">`
5. Change the language of your store
6. Refresh the cart page
7. Repeat steps 3 and 4. You should see the same result.
