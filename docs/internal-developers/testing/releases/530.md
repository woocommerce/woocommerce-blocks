## Feature plugin only

### Hide the Cart and Checkout blocks from the new block-based widget editor. ([4303](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4303))

1. Using a classic theme (ie: Storefront) with Gutenberg enabled, go to Appearance > Widgets.
2. Verify you can't add the Cart block or the Checkout block. (You will see a widget called Cart, that's the widget from WC core and is not related to this PR, so ignore it).
3. Now go to Appearance > Customize > Widgets and open a widget area.
4. Verify you can't add the Cart block or the Checkout block either.

### Fix some missing translations from the Cart and Checkout blocks. ([4295](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4295))

1. Create a checkout page with the Checkout block
2. Change your site language to a fully localized language as es-Es. ([Translation status](https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/es/default/wp-plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/))
3. Go to Updates, scroll down and click update translation.
4. Navigate to the checkout page and see that the checkout fields are being translated correctly.

### Fix the flickering of the Proceed to Checkout button on quantity update in the Cart Block. ([4293](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4293))

1. Smoke test Cart block, make sure changing quantity works fine.
2. Make sure removing items works fine.
3. When changing an item quantity, make sure the button is disabled immediately as you change the quantity and is re-enabled once the server request finishes

### Fix a bug in which Cart Widget didn't update when adding items from the All Products block. ([4291](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4291))

1. Use a theme that shows the Mini Cart in the header, like Storefront
2. Go to a page with the All Products block in the content.
3. Click on the Add to Cart button for a product.
4. View the Mini Cart in the header and the total should be updated to reflect the change.

### Fix a display issue when itemized taxes are enabled, but no products in the cart are taxable. ([4284](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4284))

## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce core

### Fix an issue where an attempt to add an out-of-stock product to the cart was made when clicking the "Read more" button. ([4265](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4265))

1. Go to 'WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Enable AJAX add to cart buttons on archives
2. Edit a page and add a 'Products by Category' block (choose a category with an out of stock product)
3. On the front-end, go to the page and click on the out of stock product's "Read more" link
4. Verify you cannot see the spinner on the button and when redirected on the product page, the WooCommerce error message does not show.
