## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce

### Add PHP templates support to the Active Product Filters block. ([6295](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/6295))

1. With a block theme, go to Edit Site > Product Catalog.
2. Add `Active Product Filters`, `Filter Products by Stock`, `Filter Products by Attribute`, `Filter Products by Price` blocks to the template.
3. Go to the shop page on the front end.
4. Select some filters, see the page reload and the selected filters appear in the Active Products Filters block.
5. Remove an arbitrary filter, see the page reload and the removed filter doesn't appear in the Active Product Filters block. See the filtered product results updates accordingly.

### Enhanced the _Featured Category block_ ([6276](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/6276))

1. Use a block theme (such as Twenty Twenty Two)
2. Add the ”Featured Category” block to a page and select a product.
3. Make sure that the resizable handle is a shown fully (it should be a full circle), and that is shown only when the block is selected.
4. Select the block and apply a Duotone filter.
5. Make sure the overlay color control is under the `Overlay` section and change the overlay color to a gradient.
6. Add a padding to the block and make sure the padding is added on the inside of the wrapper (i.e. no white space is created outside of the block).
7. Move around your image focal point and make sure you can actually move around the entire image and not only constrained on one dimension.
8. Apply “Image fit > Cover” and notice how the image will scale along with the container. As opposed to point 5 above, now the focal point picker is limited to one dimension.
9. Increase the `padding-top` of the block and notice that the content can't get pushed out of the container, but instead the container resizes.
10. When that's the case, try resizing the block through the handle to a lower height: the handle should move but the container should not resize. When the mouse is lifted, the handle should return to its original position.
11. For the steps 4–9 above, save the page and check that the styles are applied correctly on the front-end (as the block is rendered statically via PHP).

### Allow adding the Filter Products by Stock block to Product Catalog templates to filter products. ([6261](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/6261))

1. With a block theme, go to Appearance > Editor > Template > Product Catalog.
2. Add the Filter Products by Stock block above the product grid.
3. Be sure that you have some out stock products. Check "out of stock" on the frontend.
4. Notice the page reloads and the list of products updates accordingly.
5. Add a test page to your site with the `All Products` block, and the `Filter Product by Stock` block and ensure no regressions have been introduced here.

### Enhanced the _Featured Product block_ ([6181](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/6181))

1. Use a block theme (such as Twenty Twenty Two)
2. Add the ”Featured Product” block to a page and select a product.
3. Make sure that the resizable handle is a shown fully (it should be a full circle), and that is shown only when the block is selected.
4. Select the block and apply a Duotone filter.
5. Make sure the overlay color control is under the `Overlay` section and change the overlay color to a gradient.
6. Add a padding to the block and make sure the padding is added on the inside of the wrapper (i.e. no white space is created outside of the block).
7. Move around your image focal point and make sure you can actually move around the entire image and not only constrained on one dimension.

11. For the steps 4–9 above, save the page and check that the styles are applied correctly on the front-end (as the block is rendered statically via PHP).
