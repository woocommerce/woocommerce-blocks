## Testing notes

## Correctly sort translated state and country drop-down menus in Checkout block. #2779

In some languages, the `State` and `Country` drop-down menus in the checkout block were sorted incorrectly. They should now be alphabetically sorted in all circumstances.

1. Edit the `Checkout` page, remove the `[checkout]` shortcode, add the `Checkout` block, and save changes.
1. Go to `Dashboard > Settings > General`, select `Català` from `Site Language`, click `Save Changes`.
1. Update language packs: `Dashboard > Updates > Download translation packs`.
1. View the front end of your site and add a product to the cart. Navigate to checkout page.
1. In checkout, select `Espanya` (Spain) from `País / Regió` (country) dropdown.
1. Click `Província` (state) dropdown and confirm that the menu items are alphabetically sorted.
