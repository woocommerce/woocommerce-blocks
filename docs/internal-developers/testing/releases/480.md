Zip file for testing: [woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/files/6236544/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

## Feature plugin only

### General smoke testing

The following are related to various changes impacting some existing flows so just need validated there's nothing broken:

-   Place orders via the Checkout block starting from the Cart Block & shortcode
-   Test existing payment methods work as expected
-   In the frontend, verify blocks also look correct and styles are loaded properly.

### Expose the shouldSavePayment method value to registered payment methods (#3990)

Just smoke test existing payment methods to ensure there is no breakage with existing behaviour. It should surface immediately if there is.

### Refactor Payment Methods Integration API to fire onPaymentProcessing event with saved tokens (#3982)

The changes here implement any payment method type processing, so it's important to verify there is no impact to existing payment method handling by these changes. This means setting up an environment where you have the core payment methods and Stripe (along with Stripe express payments, either Chrome Pay or Apple Pay) available for testing.

-   [ ] Verify that you can pay with a saved token.
-   [ ] Verify that you can pay with an express payment method (Apple Pay or Chrome Pay - either working should be sufficient).
-   [ ] Verify that you can pay with a Stripe Credit Card
-   [ ] Verify that you can pay with any other Woo core payment method.
-   [ ] Try all of the above (except saved token) in incognito mode.

### Fix customer address country saving to orders in certain circumstances (#4013)

1. Go to the shortcode Cart, ensure the Shipping calculator has a saved address in.
2. If it does not, then you may need to complete an order.
3. Open the Shipping calculator and save the address without making any changes.
4. Proceed to checkout (you should be using the checkout _block_) and try to complete the order without changing any address fields. (You may need to fill the missing required fields)
5. Make sure you are able to submit the order without validation errors for address fields

### Fix the Proceed to checkout button click bug happening when the Coupon error is visible in the Cart block. (#3996)

-   Add any product to the Cart and go to the Cart block.
-   Enter an invalid coupon code.
-   See coupon validation error appear
-   Click on the "Proceed to Checkout" button
-   Notice you are directed to the Checkout
