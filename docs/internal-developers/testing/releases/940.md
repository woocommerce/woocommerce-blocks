### Correctly detect compatible express payment methods. ([8201](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8201))

#### Highlight incompatible payment gateways using a sidebar notice

1. Add incompatible payment gateways with the C&C Blocks (e.g., Paypal, Klarna Payments). You will need to configure them to be detected and used by WooCommerce.
2. Create a new page and add the `Checkout Block`
3. Verify there is a notice in the sidebar displaying the list of incompatible gateways. The `make as default` & `sidebar compatibility` notices should be hidden while the `incompatible gateways` notice is displayed.

4. Select each inner block in the Checkout Blocks' `List View` to ensure our notice is displayed for each one.
5. Dismiss the `incompatible gateways` notice by clicking the top right `X` button. The `make as default` & `sidebar compatibility` notices should be visible again.

6. Do the same test from step 2 to 5 using the `Cart Block`
