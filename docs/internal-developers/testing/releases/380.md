# Testing notes and ZIP for release 3.8.0

Zip file for testing: [woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/files/5516903/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

## The following changes affect the feature plugin only

### Show the phone number field in the billing section when shipping is disabled in settings. ([3376](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3376))

Moves the rendering of address fields to a single file so that PhoneNumber (new component) can be rendered in either billing or shipping, depending on visibility, without duplication.

0. Ensure the phone number field is enabled in Checkout block settings, then test 2 cases:
1. With shipping enabled, ensure phone number displays beneath the shipping step.
2. With shipping disabled (you can delete all rates and zones to edit general settings), ensure phone number displays beneath the billing step.
3. In both scenarios the values should change and be saved correctly.

## The following changes affect feature plugin and WooCommerce package

### Change delimiter used for splitChunks from tilde to hyphens. ([3360](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3360))

0. Complete a build and smoke test block inserter - atomic blocks would be affected if this broke anything ( in Core those blocks are only accessible when editing the All Products block ).
1. Confirm -- usage in built files.
