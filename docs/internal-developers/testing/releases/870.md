### Exposed data related to the checkout through wordpress/data stores ([6612](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/6612))

#### User Facing Testing

The full instructions for testing this PR can be
found [here](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/blob/trunk/docs/internal-developers/testing/cart-checkout/data-stores.md)
. At a minimum, we will need to smoke test by trying the
different [stripe failure](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/blob/trunk/docs/internal-developers/testing/cart-checkout/data-stores.md#stripe-failures)
modes

### Add simple, large & two menus footer patterns. ([7306](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7306))

#### User Facing Testing

1. In a new page or a template, go to the patterns tab and make sure all 6 patterns appear under the WooCommerce
   category dropdown.
2. Insert each one of the footer patterns, save and make sure they all look as expected on the GH discussions.

### Add minimal, large, and essential header patterns ([7292](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7292))

#### User Facing Testing

1. In a new page or a template, go to the patterns tab and make sure all 6 patterns appear under the WooCommerce
   category dropdown.
2. Insert each one of the header patterns, save and make sure they all look as expected on the GH discussions.

### Add `showRemoveItemLink` as a new checkout filter to allow extensions to toggle the visibility of the `Remove item` button under each cart line item. ([7242](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7242))

#### User Facing Testing

1. Install [this test plugin](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/files/9665640/some-extension-name.zip)
   to your site and activate it. It contains a filter to prevent the `Remove item` button showing up for a product
   called `Beanie`
2. Add a product named Beanie to your cart.
3. Go to the Cart block.
4. Ensure you cannot see a button to remove it from your cart.
5. View the `docs/third-party-developers/extensibility/checkout-block/available-filters.md` file and ensure it is good,
   and the new text we added to describe the filter makes sense.

### Add support for a GT tracking ID for Google Analytics ([7213](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7213))

#### User Facing Testing

1. Install
   the [Google Analytics Integration Extension](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration)
2. Set up the extension with a GT-X type ID from your Google Analytics account. Google Analytics account is required to
   test this. This can be retrieved by going to the [analytics dashboard](https://analytics.google.com/) and going to a
   data stream > Configure Tag Settings, see full
   instructions [here](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/12002338#zippy=%2Cset-up-your-google-tag-from-google-analytics-instructions)
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11388669/191953041-8593adb6-5dec-403c-9e73-45f6337ddb4b.png)
3. Install [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=en) browser extension. It needs to be installed, but do not click it (debug mode should be off).

4. Go to the store and trigger some events using the All Products Block and Cart block. For example an add to cart
   event.
5. Google Analytics Debugger should indicate that an event was fired.
6. Instead of the Google Analytics Debugger we can also check the Browser Dev Tools > Network and confirm we see
   requests being sent to a URL similar to: `https://region1.google-analytics.com/g/collect` (region could vary)
