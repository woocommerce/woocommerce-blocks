### Bug Fixes

#### Fix: Made migration migrate block templates in the current theme. [#10641](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10641)

1. Install a theme that uses block templates. In my case I used FotaWP.
2. Go to Appearance > Edit > Templates and reset the cart/checkout templates to default.
3. Delete has_migrated_cart and has_migrated_checkout options from your options database.
4. View a page on the store.
5. Confirm by viewing the cart and checkout pages that they inherited the block template from the theme. In this case for instance, instead of the default distraction free template we had, you'll see something like this:

#### Fix/10530 Inconsistent new install behaviour for templates when using block themes. [#10608](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10608)

1. Get a new env ready to install WP/WC using WP-CLI. You can use this [quick docker setup](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/files/12394720/new-test-env.zip)
2. Alias or copy this branch, built ready to use as a plugin into the env
3. Using WP-CLI set up WC using the following command sequence (alter args to suit your case)

```sh
wp config create --dbname=wordpress --dbuser=wordpress --dbpass=wordpress --dbhost=db  --force
wp core install --url=http://localhost --title='WP Staging' --admin_user=admin --admin_password=pass --admin_email=admin@wp.loc
wp option set blog_public 0
wp plugin activate woocommerce-blocks
wp plugin install woocommerce --version=6.0.0
wp plugin activate woocommerce
wp plugin install wordpress-importer --activate
wp import ./wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/sample-data/sample_products.xml --authors=skip
wp plugin update woocommerce
```

4. Visit the store for the first time, head to Appearance > Editor > Templates > Manage all templates verify that Cart and Checkout have customizations saved
5. Open each one and verify they contain the shortcode version
6. Test the complete checkout flow.
