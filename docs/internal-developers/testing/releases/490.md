### Enable Google Analytics Integration (#4020)

-   Install the [Google Analytics Integration Extension](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration)
-   Setup the extension with a G-X type ID from your Google Analytics account. Google Analytics account is required to test this.
-   Install [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=en) browser extension. It needs to be installed, but do not click it (debug mode should be off).
-   Go to the store and trigger some events using the All Products Block and Cart block (feature plugin only). See list of events in <https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3953>.
-   Google Analytics Debugger should indicate that an event was fired.

To test SSR blocks:

1. Insert product grid block into a page
2. View the page. Check a view_item_list event fired in GA.

To test the checkout functionality (feature plugin only):

1. Visit checkout with items in your cart. You will see a begin_checkout event
2. Start editing fields. Depending on the field you edit (which step) you will see a checkout_progress event. e.g. adding billing information will add checkout_progress with a number indicating the step you are on.
3. Select a shipping rate. See that a set_checkout_option event fired.
4. Select a payment method. See that a set_checkout_option fired.
5. Leave a required field blank and place order. See _exception_ event.
6. Place order. See add_payment_info event.

    -   Changing quantities works as expected.
    -   Shipping interaction works as expected.

    _Testing steps of these PRs are included in this section: Fix Circular Dependencies During Builds (#4025), Remove useCheckoutRedirectUrl() (#4032) and Update @automattic/data-stores and remove mapped-types.ts (#4024)_

### Load translation file for JS files that has translatable strings (#4050))

-   In WooCommerce > Settings check the option to Enable tax rates and calculations.
-   In the Tax tab, set `Display prices during cart and checkout` to `Excluding tax` and `Display tax totals` to `As a single total`.
-   In the Standard rates tab, make sure you have at least one tax rate created. If not, create it.
-   In Settings > General, change site language to something other than English; Spanish is a good example of a 100% translated language.
-   Go to Dashboard > Updates and scroll down to download the new translations immediately.
-   Visit Cart or Checkout block.
-   Strings like `Taxes` should be translated (in Spanish, it should be `Impuestos`).
