Zip file for testing: [woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/files/10346588/woocommerce-blocks.zip)

## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce

### Refactor Filter Wrapper to remove usage of useInnerBlocksProps [#8095](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8095) and Add back ToggleButtonControl component in WC Blocks 8.9 so it supports WP 5.9 [#8101](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8101)

1. In WP 5.8.
2. Create a post or page.
3. Add the Filter by Attribute block.
4. Select one of the attributes.
5. Verify the block is added correctly, you can publish the post/page and there is no error.
6. Play around with the block display settings and verify the block honors them:

7. Test also these blocks (in all of them, interact with the toggles on the sidebar of the editor and verify the block doesn't crash and the settings are applied correctly):
   * Feature Product
   * Featured Category
   * Product Image (you will need to add the All Products block, click on the pencil icon to edit its inner blocks, and select the image)
   * Active Product Filters (you will need to select the Controls inner block)
   * Filter by Price (you will need to select the Controls inner block)
   * Product Categories List
