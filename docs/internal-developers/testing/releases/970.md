## WooCommerce Core

### Set inherit default to true when products is inserted on archive product templates ([8375](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8375))

1. Make sure you are using a block theme.
2. Go to the `Products by Category` template on the `Site Editor`.
3. Insert the `Products (Beta)` block.
4. Make sure the `Inherit query from template` is **enabled** by default.
5. Repeat for the `Products by Tag`, `Products by Attribute`, `Product Search Results`, and `Product Catalog` templates.
6. Go to any other template (like `Single Product` or `Page`), insert the `Products (Beta)` block, and make sure the `Inherit query from template` is **disabled** by default.
7. Create a new page or post and make sure you can insert the `Products (Beta)` block.

### Fixes CSS spacing and availability issues for breadcrumb, catalog sort, and result count blocks. ([8391](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8391))

The issues are primarily visible with the Twenty Twenty Two theme. However, testing should be done against some other themes to make sure this doesn't introduce significant issues with those themes. In theory, it _shouldn't_ because the CSS for the blocks should appropriately inherit what the theme provides for default margins and spacing in the container around the blocks.

1. Go to the "Product Catalog" Template in the Site Editor (`Appearance` -> `Editor`).
2. Paste the following after the header in the template:

```html
<!-- wp:group {"layout":{"type":"flex","flexWrap":"nowrap"}} -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><!-- wp:woocommerce/breadcrumbs {"textColor":"pale-pink","style":{"elements":{"link":{"color":{"text":"var:preset|color|light-green-cyan"}}}}} /-->

<!-- wp:woocommerce/catalog-sorting /-->

<!-- wp:woocommerce/product-results-count {"textColor":"vivid-green-cyan"} /--></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

3. Make sure that in the editor view the alignment for the blocks appears as in the above screenshots.
4. Make sure that the shop catalog on the frontend (default is `sitedomain.com/shop` on most WP installs) shows all blocks aligned as in the above screenshots.

##### Breadcrumbs not even displaying for shop page

While it appears okay when editing the Product Catalog template, it is not shown on the frontend for certain themes. It surfaced with Twenty Twenty Two (or derivatives of that theme) for me.

#### Editor Preview

The editor preview is just a placeholder in this initial moment: the style will change a bit later on as @vivialice and I had a convo today, and she is actively working on a design for it. Here's the current implementation:

<img width="414" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-28 at 12 27 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15730971/221840837-689bae27-e952-4a9c-9d55-a3ea10cf4cf2.png">

We discussed adding placeholders (gray boxes) for the additional content that may or may not be visible depending on the product type last week. As this approach was implemented, the end result was a bit polluted, so I defaulted to relying exclusively on the notice instead.

#### Editor Sidebar

<img width="285" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-30 at 20 30 26" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15730971/215576964-37331401-af66-414b-a15a-515a8d9b723d.png">

PS: The icon for this block also needs design review/approval cc: @vivialice .

#### Frontend

The content displayed on the frontend is dynamically changed depending on the product type:

##### Simple Product

0. Create three posts, one with the Mini Cart block, another one with the Cart block and the last one with the Checkout block.

#### Test different themes

1. Twenty Twenty Three:
    1.1. Install it from [here](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/).
    1.2. Go to the pages created in step 0 and verify the Mini Cart, Cart and Checkout buttons **follow** the theme styles.
    1.3. Go to Appearance > Editor > Styles > Browse Styles and change between style variations. Verify the buttons follow the styles in all of them.

3. Storefront or another classic theme (test that this PR doesn't introduce any regression):
    3.1. Install it from [here](https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/).
    3.2. Go to the pages created in step 0 and verify the Mini Cart, Cart and Checkout buttons **don't follow** the theme styles. Instead, they have opinionated styles.

### Update Product Details block so it inherits more styles from the theme ([8494](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8494))

Repeat these testing steps with at least three themes: [TT2](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/), [TT3](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/) and any other block theme which is not a child theme of TT2/TT3 (ie, [Pixl](https://wordpress.org/themes/pixl/)).

1. Go to Appearance > Editor and edit the Single Product template.
2. Add the Product Details block after the Classic Template block.
3. Verify the styling of the tabs of the Classic Template and Single Product block look the same in the frontend.

**Testing the editor view:**

It's possible to test the editor view as well if you build WC core from this branch: `fix/load-theme-specific-stylesheet-in-site-editor` (see related PR: [woocommerce#36911](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/36911)).

Then, follow the same steps:

1. Go to Appearance > Editor and edit the Single Product template.
2. Add the Product Details block after the Classic Template block.
3. Verify the styling of the tabs of the Classic Template and Single Product block look the same in the editor.

### Show Cart and Checkout blocks in Style Book ([8489](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8489))

1. Ensure that a block theme is installed, e.g. [TT3](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/) and install [Gutenberg v15.1.0](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/download/v15.1.0/gutenberg.zip)
