## Feature plugin

### Ensure onChange is set for radio buttons in `SavedPaymentMethodOptions` ([6825](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/6825))

1.  Install Stripe, set it up so you can use it at Checkout.
2.  Add items to your cart and go to checkout. Add a credit/debit card via stripe and choose `Save payment information to my account for future purchases.`
3.  Check out. Repeat step 2 once more with a different card number. **Ensure the new card you use ends in four different numbers than the first one!** You can see test cards here: <https://stripe.com/docs/testing>
4.  Add items to your cart and go to checkout a third time. This time ensure you can switch between saved cards.

5.  Check out successfully, and then go to the back end of your site. Go to the orders you made (WooCommerce -> Orders) and for each order check the payment method used (you'll need to follow this through to Stripe), and ensure the card number used matches the one you chose in the Checkout block.
