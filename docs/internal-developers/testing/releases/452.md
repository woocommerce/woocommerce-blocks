2. Add any product to your cart and go to the Cart and Checkout blocks.
3. Verify cart line prices are displayed correctly, instead of being `0`.

### Show total sale badge in medium carts & make it display below price [(3879)](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/3879)

1. Set your currency settings to display without a decimal place, like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3616980/108694932-fae92d00-74ff-11eb-8ab5-d2038527ea98.png)
1. Add a product that is on sale to your cart, if you've got an up to date WooCommerce Subscriptions repo (on branch: `feature/checkout-block-simple-multiple-subscriptions`) then add a subscription product that's on sale, too.
1. View the Cart block and ensure the price and sale badge display well.
