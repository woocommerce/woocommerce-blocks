### Revert "Remove unused Add to Cart product element (#11948)" [#12033](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/12033)

1. Add the Mini-Cart block and the All Products block to the same post or page.
2. View the post in the frontend.
3. Open the Mini-Cart.
4. Verify there is no JS error and the Mini-Cart contents (in case you have added a product to your cart) can be seen.

### Implement the Block Hooks API to automatically inject the Mini-Cart block [#11745](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/11745)

Currently, the application of this auto-injection _only_ applies when Twenty Twenty-Four is active. In future iterations, we can expand the list of themes this supports as we test this out and/or eventually remove the restrictions once the Block Hooks API has more support.

General expectations for testing:

- The mini-cart block should only appear after the navigation block in header patterns or template parts.
- It should not appear in custom patterns or template parts.
- It should only be auto-injected when the Twenty Twenty-Four theme is active.
- You should never see two mini-cart blocks in a header pattern or template part (for example WooCommerce header patterns should be untouched).
- If the mini-cart block is moved or removed and the template part/pattern/template is saved, that should persist and not change on reload.
- The auto-injection should be reflected on the frontend.

With TT4 active

- [ ] First test without these changes and take note of header template parts and patterns that don't have the mini-cart block (via the site editor).
- [ ] With this work enabled, verify that header template parts and patterns have the mini-cart block injected (see GIFs below for expectations).

This is how things look _before_ this PR's changes:

And how things look after:

- [ ] Validate the general expectations and verify they are true.
