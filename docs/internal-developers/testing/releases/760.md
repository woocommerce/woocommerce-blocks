### Featured Category: Add background color option. ([6368](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/6368))

Prerequisites:

-   Use the latest WordPress version (we want to use the site editor / Global Styles in testing).
-   Install & use a block theme e.g.[ Twenty Twenty-Two](https://pcm.wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/).

1. Create a new post/page.
2. In the editor, add two `Featured Category` blocks.
3. For each block select the same category, it should have a product picture.
4. Select each block and use the Replace button in the block toolbar to add a product image smaller than the Featured Category block (for an example see screenshots above).
5. Now select the first `Featured Category` block. In the editor sidebar's `Color` section of the block select a `Background` color. The background color should be visible in the parts not covered by the product image.
6. Save your post/page.
7. In the admin dashboard navigate to `Appearance` > `Editor` (`/wp-admin/site-editor.php`).
8. Open the Styles sidebar by clicking the round Styles icon in the top right of the editor.
9. In the Styles sidebar navigate to `Blocks` > `Featured Category` > `Colors` > `Background`.

12. The first block should still show the background color you selected in step 5. The second block should show the Global Styles color you selected in step 10.
