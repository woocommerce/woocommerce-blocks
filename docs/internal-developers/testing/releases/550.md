Zip file for testing: [woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/files/6763909/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

## Feature plugin only

### Wrap components in the Cart and Checkout sidebar in a TotalsWrapper. This will ensure consistent spacing and borders are applied to items in the sidebar. ([4415](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4415))

1. Add only virtual products to your cart (i.e. ones that don't need shipping).
2. Go to the Cart and Checkout blocks and verify that there are no double borders or empty sections in the sidebars.
3. Add a product that does need shipping to your cart and go back to the Cart and Checkout blocks. Verify that the Shipping section is present, and again verify that there are no double borders, or empty sections.
4. Go to WooCommerce -> Settings and disable coupons in the store.
5. Go back to the Cart/Checkout blocks and verify there are no double borders or empty sections.
6. In WooCommerce -> Settings -> Tax set the "Calculate tax based on" option to "Customer shipping address". Then ensure you have at least one tax rate set up for a specific country. Also make sure you have no tax rates with a wildcard (\*) country name in them.
7. Go to the Cart and Checkout blocks and change your shipping address to be in the country for which you have a tax rate set up. Verify the taxes section shows in the sidebars, and that no double borders or empty sections are present.
8. Change your shipping address to be in a country that your store doesn't have a tax rate for. Verify no empty sections or double borders are present.

## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce core

### Add screen reader text to price ranges. ([4367](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4367))

1. View the All Products block.
2. Find a product with a price range (grouped product), e.g. Logo Collection in the default content.
3. Use VoiceOver or screen reader to read the price e.g. using VoiceOver use the Tab key to get to the "View Products" button, then use Control+Option+Left to select the price. It should announce "Price between X and X". Some tools will also read the other price but this is wrapped in aria-hidden so can be ignored.

### Allow HTML in All Products Block Product Titles. ([4363](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4363))

1. Edit a product and add HTML to the title e.g. `<strong>Text</strong>`.
2. View the product within the All Products Block.
3. Confirm the strong tag is rendered, rather than the HTML as a string.

### Ensure product grids display as intended in the editor. ([4424](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4424))

Test in the block editor:

1. Ensure the Gutenberg feature plugin is enabled and up to date.
2. Create a new page.
3. Insert blocks that use the product grid e.g. _Top Rated Products_.
4. Save the page as a draft.
5. Navigate to Pages > All Pages and then select `Edit` on the draft you just saved.
6. Confirm that the number of columns displayed equals the number set in the block settings (Default: 3).

Test in the widget editor:

1. Ensure the Gutenberg feature plugin is enabled and up to date.
2. Go to the Widgets editor in Appearance > Widgets.
3. Go to Sidebar widgets and insert blocks that use the product grid e.g. _Top Rated Products_.
4. Confirm that the number of columns displayed equals the number set in the block settings (Default: 3).
