## WooCommerce Core

### Fix the Checkout Blocks "Payment Options" settings crash in the editor. ([8535](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8535))

1. Install and enable an incompatible payment gateway plugin with the `Cart` & `Checkout` Blocks. (e.g., [IDPay Payment Gateway for Woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-idpay-gateway/))
2. Create a new page and add the `Checkout` Block
3. Select the Checkout Block or any of its Inner Blocks (except for the `Payment Options` Inner Block). Ensure our incompatible payment gateway (e.g., IDPay) is listed under the incompatible gateways notice:

4. Select the `Payment Options` Inner Block. Ensure its settings are correctly displayed, the incompatible gateways notice is showing and our incompatible payment Gateway is highlighted under `Settings -> Block -> Methods`
