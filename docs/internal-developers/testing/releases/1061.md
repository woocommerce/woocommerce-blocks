2. Create a new post.

6. Save the post and go to the front-end
7. Make sure you can use all filters as expected and without any problems/errors: the product counts should match the number of existing products in the store with the filtered criteria, not just what is displayed on the page.
8. Repeat all steps from 2 to 7, but using the Products Collection block instead of Products (beta). Make sure all filters work as expected.
