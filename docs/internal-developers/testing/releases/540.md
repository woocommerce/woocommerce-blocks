Zip file for testing: [woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/files/6694563/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

## Feature plugin only

### Show loading state in the express payments area whilst payment is processing or the page is redirecting. ([4228](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4228))

To test this properly you'll need Stripe setup locally in sandbox mode. You can test the express payments with Chrome/Edge Pay, or Apple Pay in Safari.

1. Add an item to the cart
2. Go to checkout and wait for express payment methods to display
3. Toggle to change shipping; express payments should show the loading spinner and be blocked until the request is complete
4. Pay using an express payment method
5. After clicking Pay, the express payments area will show a loading spinner. When the request is complete and the checkout starts to redirect, the express payments area will remain blocked (no spinner).

### Fix a warning shown when fees are included in the order. ([4360](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4360))

1. Add fees to your cart (using the extra fees extension <https://woocommerce.com/products/extra-fees-for-woocommerce/> set up an order fee, or any other combination of fees).
2. Go to the cart/checkout blocks and ensure no console warning is shown.

### Prevent PHP notice for variable products without enabled variations. ([4317](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4317))

1. Create a variable product with one disabled variation and at least one variation attribute.
2. Create a new blog post with a "Product category" block and select the category that contains the newly created product.
3. Visiting the new blog post throws a PHP notice (NOTICE: PHP message: WordPress database error You have an error in your SQL syntax ...)

## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce core

### Made script and style handles consistent. ([4324](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4324))

1. Smoke test blocks and make sure they're insertable.

### Allow products to be added by SKU in the Hand-picked Products block. ([4366](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4366))

1. Insert the Hand-picked Products block
2. See SKUs shown for products with a SKU
3. Try searching for a SKU. See results.
