-   After setting up those pages, the notice should be gone and links should work fine.
-   You can edit the text, and it would persist on frontend.
-   If you remove or change the links, you will get a warning that you must insert the correct links.
-   If you require checkbox on the block, you should not be able to place an order on the frontend without checking it.

### Improve the Checkout Order Summary block accessibility by making more info available to screen readers. ([4810](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4810))

-   Add one or more items to your cart.
-   Visit Checkout and click on Order Summary to expand the tab, or navigate to it using TAB key.

### Pass billingData to canMakePayment and debounce its calls ([4776](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4776))

-   Add this code somewhere (you can try `assets/js/base/context/providers/cart-checkout/payment-methods/use-payment-method-registration.ts`).
-   If you can't edit files, install `Custom CSS & JS` plugin and insert this code:

```js
wc.wcBlocksRegistry.registerPaymentMethodExtensionCallbacks(
	'woocommerce-marketplace-extension',
	{
		cod: ( arg ) => {
			console.log( 'checking COD' );
			return arg.billingData.first_name === 'Alexandra';
		},
	}
);
```

-   Make the console visible
-   Go to Checkout block and notice that COD payment method is missing and that an initial check was made COD (see console.log())
-   Deselect Use same address for billing and write "Alexandra" for First Name in the Billing Address section. Cash on Delivery option should be available as a payment method.

-   As the previous step, paste this code somewhere:

```js
wc.wcBlocksRegistry.registerExpressPaymentMethod( {
	name: 'expressMethod',
	edit: null,
	content: wp.element.createElement( 'div', {}, 'My express test method' ),
	canMakePayment: () => true,
	paymentMethodId: 'expressMethod',
	supports: {
		features: [ 'products' ],
	},
} );
```

-   Make sure that you see "My express test method" in Checkout.
-   Add this code now:

```js
wc.wcBlocksRegistry.registerPaymentMethodExtensionCallbacks(
	'woocommerce-marketplace-extension',
	{
		expressMethod: ( arg ) => {
			console.log( 'canMakePayment expressMethod' );
			return false;
		},
	}
);
```

-   You shouldn't be able to see that express method now.
-   Remove the code.

-   Set a shipping zone in a country of your choice
-   Add a physical product to your cart and enter a country that isn't covered by the shipping zone
-   Clicking "Place Order" should throw an exception which should be displayed in the checkout, whilst preventing you from placing an order.

### Show placeholder message in the shipping section when there are no rates. ([4765](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4765))
