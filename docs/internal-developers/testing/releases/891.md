## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce

### Display correct block template when filtering by attribute. ([7640](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7640))

#### Test that #7604 has been fixed

1. Make sure you have a block theme active (like Twenty Twenty-Three).
2. Add the “Filter by Attribute” block to the “Products by Category” template (in Appearance > Site Editor).
3. Go to the front-end for a category (ie: /product-category/clothing/).
4. Select a filter.
5. Verify the query params are added to the URL and the URL stays correct.
6. Verify the loaded template is also correct (instead of rendering the “Product Catalog” template).

#### Test that there are no regressions with #6776

1. Make sure you have a block theme active (like Twenty Twenty-Three).
2. Navigate to Products > Attributes and edit an existing one or create a new one.
3. Click the Enable Archives option and save, go back.
4. Click Configure terms next to your attribute.
5. Hover over one of the terms and click the View link of one of the attributes.
6. Verify that the page is rendered with a header, a footer, and using a product grid.
