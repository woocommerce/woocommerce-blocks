### Update check for active cart template and migration routine [#10462](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10462)

1. Go to Pages > Cart and edit the page. It will load the site editor. Add some text below the header, for example. Feel free to add anything for testing purposes. Save the template.
2. Add an item to your cart and then load the Cart page on the front end. Ensure your changes from step 1 are visible.
3. Go to the WP Dashboard, then WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced and change the cart page slug to something different. Repeat step 2 and ensure it still works with your change visible. Ensure the path to the Cart page shown in your browser is the one you updated it to.
