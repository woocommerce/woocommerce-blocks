## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce

### Fix infinite recursion when removing an attribute filter from the Active filters block ([4816](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/4816))

1. Insert All Products, Filter Products by Attribute, and Active Filter blocks into a page.
2. Save and publish the page.
3. View the page on the frontend.
4. Apply a filter for any attribute so that the product list is filtered and the active filters block shows the filter you just added.
5. Verify you can remove applied attribute filters either using the cross icon next to each filter, or pressing the "Clear All" link.
