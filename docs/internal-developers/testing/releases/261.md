## To test

1. View your stock table (`wc_reserved_stock`) in the database

3. Check the stock table is updated with a new row
4. Refresh the checkout page.
5. Check that the expires column is updated only

To test stock table creation:

_Note: assuming you are using a development site where you are okay with losing the data._

1. Delete the `wc_reserved_stock` table.
2. Visit anywhere in the WordPress admin.
3. Verify the `wc_reserved_stock` table was re-created.
