## Overview

The payment data store is used to store payment method data and payment processing information. When the payment status
changes, the data store will reflect this.

Currently, all the actions are internal-only while we determine which ones will be useful for extensions to interact
with. We do not encourage extensions to dispatch actions onto this data store yet.

## Selectors

### isExpressPaymentMethodActive

Returns whether an express payment method is active, this will be true when the express payment method is open and
taking user input. In the case of GPay it is when the modal is open but other payment methods may have different UIs.

#### _Returns_

`boolean` - Whether an express payment method is active.

#### Example

```js
const store = select( 'wc/store/payment' );
const isExpressPaymentMethodActive = store.isExpressPaymentMethodActive();
```

### getActiveSavedToken

Returns the active saved token. Payment methods that customers have saved to their account have tokens associated with
them. If one of these is selected then this selector returns the token that is currently active. If one is not selected
this will return an empty string.

#### _Returns_

`string` - The active saved token ID, or empty string if a saved token is not selected.

#### Example

```js
const store = select( 'wc/store/payment' );
const activeSavedToken = store.getActiveSavedToken();
```

### getActivePaymentMethod

Returns the active payment method's ID.

#### _Returns_

`string` - The active payment method's ID.

#### Example

```js
const store = select( 'wc/store/payment' );
const activePaymentMethod = store.getActivePaymentMethod();
```

### getAvailablePaymentMethods

Returns the available payment methods. This does not include express payment methods.

#### _Returns_

`object` - The available payment methods. This is currently just an object keyed by the payment method IDs. Each member
contains a `name` entry with the payment method ID as its value.

#### Example

```js
const store = select( 'wc/store/payment' );
const availablePaymentMethods = store.getAvailablePaymentMethods();
```

`availablePaymentMethods` will look like this:

```js
{
    "cheque": {
        name: "cheque",
    },
    "cod": {
        name: "cod",
    },
    "bacs": {
        name: "bacs",
    },
}
```

### getAvailableExpressPaymentMethods

Returns the available express payment methods.

#### _Returns_

`object` - The available express payment methods. This is currently just an object keyed by the payment method IDs. Each
member contains a `name` entry with the payment method ID as its value.

#### Example

```js
const store = select( 'wc/store/payment' );
const availableExpressPaymentMethods = store.getAvailableExpressPaymentMethods();
```

`availableExpressPaymentMethods` will look like this:

```js
{
    "payment_request": {
        name: "payment_request",
    },
    "other_express_method": {
        name: "other_express_method",
    },
}
```

### getPaymentMethodData

Returns the current payment method data. This will change every time the active payment method changes and is not
persisted for each payment method. For example, if the customer has PayPal selected, the payment method data will be
specific to that payment method. If they switch to Stripe, the payment method data will be overwritten by Stripe, and
the previous value (when PayPal was selected) will not be available anymore.

#### _Returns_

`object` - The current payment method data. This is specific to each payment method so further details cannot be
provided here.

#### Example

```js
const store = select( 'wc/store/payment' );
const paymentMethodData = store.getPaymentMethodData();
```

### getSavedPaymentMethods

Returns all saved payment methods for the current customer.

#### _Returns_

`object` - The saved payment methods for the current customer. This is an object, it will be specific to each payment
method. As an example, Stripe's saved tokens are returned like so:

```js

        {
            method: {
                gateway: 'stripe',
                last4: '4242',
                brand: 'Visa'
            },
            expires: '04/24',
            is_default: true,
            actions: {
                wcs_deletion_error: {
                    url: '#choose_default',
                    name: 'Delete'
                }
            },
            tokenId: 2
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Example

```js
const store = select( 'wc/store/payment' );
const savedPaymentMethods = store.getSavedPaymentMethods();
```

### getActiveSavedPaymentMethods

Returns the saved payment methods for the current customer that are active, i.e. the ones that can be used to pay for
the current order.

#### _Returns_

                last4: '4242',
                brand: 'Visa'
            },
            expires: '04/24',
            is_default: true,
            actions: {
                wcs_deletion_error: {
                    url: '#choose_default',
                    name: 'Delete'
                }
            },
            tokenId: 2
        }
    ]
}
```
