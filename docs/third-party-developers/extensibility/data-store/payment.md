## Overview

The payment data store is used to store payment method data and payment processing information. When the payment status
changes, the data store will reflect this.

Currently, all the actions are internal-only while we determine which ones will be useful for extensions to interact
with. We do not encourage extensions to dispatch actions onto this data store yet.
