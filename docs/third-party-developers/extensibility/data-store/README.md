# Data Store

This document provides an overview of the data stores registered with `wp.data` for use by various blocks. Store keys are exported as constants on the `wc.wcBlocksData` export (externally registered as `@woocommerce/block-data` and enqueued via handle `wc-blocks-data-store`). For any block using the store, it's recommended to import the store key rather than using the reference directly to ensure dependencies are extracted correctly. It is assumed readers have some familiarity with the `wp.data` API. You can read more about that [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-data/).

The **[Cart Store (wc/store/cart)](cart.md)** is responsible for handling cart-related data and operations. The primary key for this store is CART_STORE_KEY.

The **[Checkout Store (wc/store/checkout)](checkout.md)** manages the checkout process, ensuring a seamless experience for users. The primary key for this store is CHECKOUT_STORE_KEY.

The **[Query-State Store (wc/store/query-state)](query-state.md)** holds arbitrary values indexed by context and key. It's often used for tracking the state of query objects for a given context. The primary key for this store is QUERY_STATE_STORE_KEY.
