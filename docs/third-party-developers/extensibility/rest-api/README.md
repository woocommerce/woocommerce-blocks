# Extending the Store API

Your application can change the way the Store API works by extending certain endpoints. It can add data to certain endpoints to make your server-side data available to the client-side.

You can also use the Store API trigger a server-side cart update from the client which will then update the client-side cart with the data returned by the API.

The documents listed below contain further details on how to achieve the above.
