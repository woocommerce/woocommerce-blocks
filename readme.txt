== Description ==

The WooCommerce Gutenberg Products block is a new block for the Gutenberg post editor. This block is a custom products area that features your WooCommerce products. The products featured can be filtered by categories, sale status, or a variety of other fields, and you can even make a custom list of hand-picked products to display. The Products block is the easiest and most flexible way to feature your products on your posts and pages!

== Getting Started ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* The latest version of the Gutenberg plugin
* WooCommerce 3.3.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 7.2 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Gutenberg Products Block” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found this plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Sample data =

WooCommerce comes with some sample data you can use to populate the products and get started building Products blocks quickly and easily. You can use the core [CSV importer](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/product-csv-importer-exporter/) or our [CSV Import Suite plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/) to import sample_products.csv.

= Where can I report bugs or contribute to the project? =
