== Description ==

WooCommerce Blocks are the easiest, most flexible way to display your products on posts and pages!

For more information on what blocks are available, and how to use them, check out the official documentation: https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-blocks/

**Note: Feature plugin for WooCommerce + Gutenberg. This plugin serves as a space to iterate and explore new Blocks and updates to existing blocks for WooCommerce, and how WooCommerce might work with the block editor.**

Use this plugin if you want access to the bleeding edge of available blocks for WooCommerce. However, stable blocks are bundled into WooCommerce, and can be added from the "WooCommerce" section in the block inserter.

WooCommerce comes with some sample data you can use to populate the products and get started building Products blocks quickly and easily. You can use the core [CSV importer](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/product-csv-importer-exporter/) or our [CSV Import Suite plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/) to import sample_products.csv.
