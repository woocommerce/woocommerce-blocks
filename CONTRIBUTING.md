# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to WooCommerce Blocks! Below are some developer docs for working with the project.

## Get started

### Required developer tools

-   [`git`](https://git-scm.com)
-   [`npm` and `node.js`](https://nodejs.org)
-   [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org)
-   A WordPress development environment - e.g. [`VVV`](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org) or [`docker`](https://www.docker.com).

### Clone repo & install code dependencies

-   Clone this repository locally - `git clone https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block.git`.
-   Change directory to your repo folder, e.g. `cd woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block`.
-   Install javascript and php dependencies - `npm install && composer install`.

### Run the plugin

-   Ensure the repo folder is in the `wp-content/plugins` folder of your WordPress environment.
-   Activate the `WooCommerce Blocks` plugin (should be dev version, e.g. `2.6.0-dev`).
-   Edit a page or post in block editor - you should see WooCommerce blocks in the block inserter!

## NPM commands

We have a set of scripts in npm to automate important developer tasks.

### Build

-   Run `$ npm run build` to build all assets for production.
-   Run `$ npm start` to run the development build and watch for changes.

These scripts compile the code using `webpack`.

You can also run `$ npx webpack` to run the development build and not keep watching.

### Lint

Run `$ npm run lint` to check code against our linting rules.

This script runs 3 sub-commands: `lint:php`, `lint:css`, `lint:js`. Use these to run linters across the codebase (linters check for valid syntax).

-   `lint:php` runs phpcs via composer, which uses the [phpcs.xml](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/blob/master/phpcs.xml) rule set.
-   `lint:css` runs stylelint over all the scss code in `assets/css`, using the rules in [.stylelintrc.json.](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/blob/master/.stylelintrc.json)
-   `lint:js` runs eslint over all the JavaScript, using the rules in [.eslintrc.js.](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/blob/master/.eslintrc.js)

### Test

Run `$ npm run test` to run unit tests on the JavaScript.

The test scripts use [wp-scripts](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/scripts) to run jest for component and unit testing.

-   `test:update` updates the snapshot tests for components, used if you change a component that has tests attached.
-   Use `test:watch` to keep watch of files and automatically re-run tests.

### Create a plugin package in ZIP format

Run `$ npm run package-plugin` to trigger install and build, and then create a zip file which you can use to install WooCommerce Blocks in WordPress admin.

## Releases

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

## Publishing `@woocommerce/block-library`

In the past, we published the blocks to NPM at [@woocommerce/block-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@woocommerce/block-library).

**Note: since version 2.3.0 `@woocommerce/block-library` has been deprecated, you shouldn't publish a new version without first discussing it with the team**

To release a new version, perform the following steps:

-   Run `npm pack` to prep a `.tgz` file.
-   Optionally test the package by uploading this onto a test site.
-   Run `npm publish --access public`, which will push the version up to npm.

## Legacy builds

This plugin supports two type of builds:

-   legacy builds (assets have `-legacy` suffix on their file names)
-   main builds (without the `-legacy` prefix)

The legacy builds are loaded in a site environment where the WordPress version doesn't meet minimum requirements for a components used in a set build.

You can read more about legacy builds in the [this doc](./assets/js/legacy/README.md).
